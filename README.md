# WeatherApp
Weather forecast app I made while learning React.js.
In this project I used AccuWeather free Weather Forecast API and create-react-app. 

It doesn't look as good as I wanted and it has some bugs. One of my biggest problems with coding new projects is the fact that by the time
I finish a project I usually stockpile enough knowledge to realize that to fix some issues I'd need to completely rebuild the app. The AccuWeather API was also very frustrating to use because of the request limit.


This is pretty much what happened to this project - it's main purpose was to teach me React and it accomplished it with great results so I'll leave it
at that. It looks and works alright anyway, I might as well move on to a more ambitious project.
